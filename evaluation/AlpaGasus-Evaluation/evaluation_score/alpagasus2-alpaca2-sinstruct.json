He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him.

This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting."

It is based on the principle that all producers, regardless of their location or economic status, should be able to access fair prices and working conditions for their products. The movement seeks to create a more equitable and sustainable global economy by encouraging consumers to purchase products that have been produced under fair trade standards.\n\nThe \"trade justice\" movement is a related initiative that focuses on the rights of workers and producers in the global economy.

The movement also seeks to ensure that producers are able to access fair prices for their products and that they are not exploited by unscrupulous buyers.\n\nThe debate on whether trade should be codified as a human right is an important one.

This can help people become more aware of their thoughts and feelings, and can help them recognize when they are feeling anxious. To practice mindfulness, people can try the following steps:\n\n1. Find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed.\n2. Sit or lie down in a comfortable position.\n3. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.\n4. Focus on your breathing and notice how it feels in your body.\n5. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breathing.\n6. Continue to focus on your breathing for a few minutes.\n7. When you're ready, open your eyes and return to your daily activities.\n\nMindfulness can help people manage their anxiety by helping them become more aware of their thoughts and feelings, and by helping them recognize when they are feeling anxious. By practicing mindfulness, people can learn to respond to their anxiety in a more productive way.\n\n",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance."
